            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Muhammad (c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam, and, along with the Quran, his teachings and practices form the basis of Islamic religious belief.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 CE into the Quraysh tribe. His father, Abdullah, died before his birth, and his mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. He was raised first by his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib and then by his uncle Abu Talib. As a young man, Muhammad worked as a merchant and shepherd. He was known among his people as "al-Amin" (the trustworthy) for his honesty and moral character.</p>
            <p>At the age of 25, Muhammad married Khadijah, a wealthy widow who was 40 years old. Their marriage was a happy one, and Khadijah was his only wife until her death 25 years later. They had several children together, including Fatimah, who would later marry Ali ibn Abi Talib.</p>

        <section id="prophethood">
            <h2>Prophethood</h2>
            
            <h3>First Revelation</h3>
            <p>According to Islamic tradition, in 610 CE, at the age of 40, Muhammad began receiving revelations from God through the angel Gabriel during his retreats in the Cave of Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour near Mecca. The first revelation commanded him to "Read" or "Recite" in the name of his Lord. Initially shaken by these experiences, Muhammad was comforted and encouraged by his wife Khadijah and her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a Christian scholar.</p>

            <h3>Preaching in Mecca</h3>
            <p>Muhammad began preaching publicly around 613 CE, proclaiming that "God is One" and that complete submission to Him is the right way of life (Islam). His message also emphasized social justice, care for the poor and orphans, and the importance of moral conduct. This message challenged the polytheistic practices and the social structure of Meccan society, leading to opposition from Meccan elites.</p>
            <p>The early Muslims faced persecution in Mecca. Despite this, Muhammad's followers grew slowly but steadily, including people from various social backgrounds. Some followers sought temporary refuge in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) under the protection of the Christian king there.</p>

        <section id="hijra">
            <h2>Migration to Medina (Hijra)</h2>
            <p>In 622 CE, facing increased persecution and threats to his life, Muhammad and his followers migrated to the city of Yathrib (later called Medina, "the city"). This migration, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad established a Muslim community and became its religious and political leader.</p>
            <p>In Medina, Muhammad drafted the Constitution of Medina, which established the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship among different communities. This document is considered one of the earliest written constitutions in history.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conflicts">
            <h2>Conflict and Expansion</h2>
            <p>The Muslim community in Medina faced conflicts with the Quraysh of Mecca, leading to several battles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Battle of Badr (624 CE):</strong> A significant victory for the Muslims despite being outnumbered</li>
                <li><strong>Battle of Uhud (625 CE):</strong> The Muslims faced setbacks</li>
                <li><strong>Battle of the Trench (627 CE):</strong> The Muslims successfully defended Medina</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 628 CE, Muhammad and his followers attempted to perform pilgrimage to Mecca but were stopped. This led to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, a ten-year truce. Two years later, in 630 CE, after the treaty was broken by allies of the Quraysh, Muhammad marched on Mecca with a large force. The city surrendered with minimal bloodshed, and Muhammad declared a general amnesty for most Meccans. He destroyed the idols in the Kaaba and rededicated the building to God.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="later-life">
            <h2>Later Life and Death</h2>
            <p>After the conquest of Mecca, most of Arabia united under Islam. Muhammad continued to receive revelations until his death. In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his first and only Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) with a large number of Muslims. During this pilgrimage, he delivered his Farewell Sermon at Mount Arafat, which summarized core Islamic principles.</p>
            <p>Muhammad died on 8 June 632 CE (12 Rabi' al-awwal 11 AH) in Medina at the age of about 62 or 63. He was buried in the house of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Mosque of the Prophet (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) now stands.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="legacy">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Muhammad's teachings and life example (Sunnah) form the basis of Islamic belief and practice. Muslims regard him as the final prophet sent by God to humanity. The Quran, which Muslims believe to be God's word as revealed to Muhammad, along with the Hadith (recorded sayings and actions of Muhammad), form the primary sources of Islamic law and theology.</p>
            <p>Islam has grown to become the second-largest religion in the world, with over 1.8 billion followers. Muhammad's influence extends beyond religion into politics, law, culture, and society across the Muslim world and beyond.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="veneration">
            <h2>Veneration</h2>
            <p>Muslims add the phrase "peace be upon him" (PBUH or ﷺ in Arabic) after saying or writing Muhammad's name as a sign of respect. In Islamic art and tradition, Muhammad is typically not depicted visually, in accordance with Islamic teachings against idolatry.</p>
